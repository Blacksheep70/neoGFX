# Introduction
neoGFX is a cross-platform C++ GUI/game library.
neoGFX is still a work in progress (incomplete) so is not yet suitable for making GUI apps or games. Currently neogfx has only been built for and tested on Windows.

# Known Problems
Example test program will crash on shut-down due to bug related to focus tabbing linked list.

# Implementation Progress
